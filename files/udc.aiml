        <random>
            <li>UPAC Concerts. A concert just for RPI! You'll find RPI has welcomed incredibly talented musicians through its door since the 70s! </li>
            <li>UPAC Comedy. Late nights are comedy nights! If you look in the right places you'll find signed copies of posters of when RPI had famous comedians over!</li>
            <li>UPAC Cinema. Fridays and Saturdays are for movie nights! If you look in the right places you'll find old magazines RPI used to advertize for movie showings</li>
            <li>Winter Carnival. A favorite of the past few decades to enjoy all things winter!</li>
            <li>GM Week. An RPI Tradition that begin in the 1940s. GM Week happens every year during the election of the student government body.
            It is commemorated with a GM Week mug and with festivities</li>
